## To prepare this data, the data was cleaned, and the following processes were performed:

### Exploratory Data Analysis
    - During the exploratory data analysis, a boxplot and histogram was visualized for each numeric datatype column. 
    - Also, a barplot was visualized for each categorical column. 
    - This gave a good baseline for all of the numeric and categorical columns for univariate EDA.
