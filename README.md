## To prepare this data, the data was cleaned, and the following processes were performed:

### Exploratory Data Analysis
    - During the exploratory data analysis, a boxplot and histogram was visualized for each numeric datatype column. 
    - Also, a barplot was visualized for each categorical column. 
    - This gave a good baseline for all of the numeric and categorical columns for univariate EDA.

This histogram shows that the majority of the sales are decreasing if the price of sales high"exponential decay curve" and the highest majority of  sales prices in range 0-2000 

 ### Expanatory Data Analysis
    - To visualize the data for explantory purposes, two bargraphs were chosen.
    - The bargraphs were chosen to show how the data compare to each other.
